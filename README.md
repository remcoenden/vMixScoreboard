vMixScoreboard retrieves data directly from Anatec scoreboards and publishes it to vMix via the vMix API. Current hardware requirements include an STM32 “Blue Pill” and a Raspberry Pi.

## Background
This project originated from a livestream initiative to broadcast top-tier matches for a local sports club. To automate score and game-time graphics, we initially used Scoreboard OCR; following pricing changes, we evaluated alternatives. Drawing on solutions used by peer clubs, we implemented a Raspberry Pi connected to the scoreboard to deliver data to vMix.
